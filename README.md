# Chain of responsability

# Customer Support System

This project demonstrates a basic customer support system designed to manage customer requests based on their priority levels. The system was built using the Chain of Responsibility pattern to handle requests efficiently at each level. It consists of three levels of support: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3, each catering to different types of requests.
